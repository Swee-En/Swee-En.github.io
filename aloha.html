            to choose from. Then, we were to identify some problems related to the theme, and design an application
            to solve that problem within 24 hours.

            <p class="bodypara">
                Car rentals is a very popular option when travelling, due to the convenience provided as opposed
                to taking public transport. However, cars also produce one of the largest amount of greenhouse gases.
                In addition, it is common for tourists to travel in small numbers, such as in pairs or even solo.
                In such cases, the space of the car is not fully utilised despite carrying the same amount of
                carbon footprint as it would when driving say, 5 pax.

                Since this was given a tight timeline of only 24 hours, not only were we unable to do an
                in-depth user research and competitor analysis, we were also unable to conduct any user
                testing for the refinement of our prototype. We also had no prior
                knowledge of UI design, hence the ideas were largely based on our personal
                knowledge and experience.

                However, this was still my very first encounter with UI design, albeit a very brief one.
                Although it was rushed, we were still able to go through most of the typical process
                of brainstorming, researching, ideating, and prototyping. It served as a start to my interest in UI
                design, which spurred me to take the UI/UX module in the later years!
