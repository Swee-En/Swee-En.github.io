            <h2 class="secondarytitles">Style Exploration</h2>
            <p class="bodypara">
                My internship started off with trying to find a suitable style for the survey illustrations.
                The priority was to choose a style which could deliver the message most effectively, thereby
                helping the survey participants to understand their options at one glance. Some of the styles
                explored include one slightly resembling that of Japanese animations, as well as pop art.
            </p>

            <div class="twopics">
                <img src="images/idc/animestyle.png" class="fpic">

        <div class="wordsec">
            <p class="bodypara">
                There was also a chance that at the later part of the internship, a tutorial video
                would be necessary to walk users through the steps of a particular process, i.e. the proposed idea.
                Hence, during the exploratory phase, I was also tasked to create a simple animation tutorial on the self
                check-in process. This was to provide an idea of how long it would take to produce an animation of a certain
                quality.

            <p class="bodypara">
                During the exploratory phase, we found that the black-and-white style was the most suitable for the survey,
                since it involves putting two illustrations side by side for users to compare between the options. As such,
                colors would have been a form of distraction.

            <h2 class="secondarytitles">Conducting Mock Interviews</h2>
            <p class="bodypara">
                In the second half of the internship, our team conducted mock interviews with the
                cleaning staff at SUTD. Our plan was to gain an insight of the interview process as well as
                refine the survey questions before conducting the survey with the cleaning staff at Changi Airport.
            </p>

            <p class="bodypara">
                The mock interview was conducted with a total of four cleaning staff. Since one of the staff
                was a Chinese speaker, we were also required to do a Chinese translation for the survey questions.
            </p>

            <p class="bodypara">
                This interview was a challenge in multiple ways, partly due to the fact that it was a group interview and it
                was hard to keep everyone engaged when it was another participant's time to share. It was also important to
                connect with the participants and help them feel at ease, so that they would be comfortable to share beyond what
                the question required. This is because oftentimes, the additional information that the 
                participants share is what gives us a more
                accurate understanding of their views and lifestyle.

                    Since the interviews could not be completed in time before my internship ended, I did not have a chance
                    to perform data analysis. However, I learnt about the various methods of filtering, grouping and presenting
                    the data during the mock interviews.
