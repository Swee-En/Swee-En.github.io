                Visual novels have always been one of the things I wanted to try, and this year I finally attempted it.
                As a Genshin Impact and Childe fan, I decided to create a spin-off of the game and character, where
                the player goes on a Valentine's date with the character at Disneyland.

                While this is still a work-in-progress, I have created some assets, including the sprites, background
                images and special scenes. The illustrations were mainly done on iPad and ibispaint, whereas the
                programming
                was done on Ren'Py, a visual novel engine. This software was also originally used to create the very
                popular
                visual novel, Doki Doki Literature Club (DDLC), before the game was recreated in the Unity engine.

                This was the first time I created design sheets for an original character, accounting for the various views,
