            We realised that packing is a very common but mostly untargeted problem. Hence, with packing difficulties as
            our
            main focus, we were to design an application to ease the packing process.

                Our research showed that while some of the existing packing applications provide suggested packing lists

                general.
                These limitations are understandable, since the number of unique categories available are far too large,

                We started off with a paper prototype where we included only the most important features,
                and performed user testing. This was to see if our initial ideas were suitable to
                be further developed. It was also easy to make quick changes, making it ideal for the initial testing.

                In the high fidelity prototype, we added in colors and decorative icons as well
                to make the application look more aesthetic and fun to use. The choice of our color palette was to let
                our application
                give off a bright energy, but at the same time have a simple and clear interface for easy use.
                We also included a loading screen!

                    as we add in the various features and designs was both a thrill and an encouragement.

                    I started off with little knowledge about UI design, but throughout the course, I learnt various

                    process.
